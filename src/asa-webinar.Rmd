## Abstract

If you want to set up your own consulting business, you need to learn a few basic business skills. You need to set up an independent financial system for income and expenses. You need to decide between a sole proprietorship, a limited liability corporation, or an S/C Corporation. You need a system for invoicing. You need to examine insurance options. This webinar will explain why each of these is important. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, an accountant, or an insurance agent. Furthermore, there are no “one size fits all” solutions. This webinar will help you know what your options are, but you should discuss your particular situation with a qualified lawyer and accountant to choose what is best for you.

I have three jobs! I am a part-time independent consultant with a sole proprietorship, P.Mean Consulting. P. Mean is short for Professor Mean, my alter-ego on the Internet. For those who don't get the joke, I point out the Professor Mean is not just your average professor.

I am also a part-time faculty member in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. 

I also have a research grant with Enterprise Analytics at Kansas University Medical Center.

If anyone is familiar with the computer term "thrashing", that is a definition of my life now. I am looking for a single full-time benefits eligible job.

## Overview

In this presentation, you will learn to

- Understand the pros and cons of consulting.
- Define the various business entities that you can use for your consulting business.
- Set up a simple process for billing and accounting.
- Discuss common elements in a consulting contract.

Thanks for the many interesting comments posted on the Statistical Consulting Section discussion forum.

Here's a brief outline of what I'll talk about today. I will try to keep my comments to 60 minutes of this 90 minute webinar. Ask questions as they occur to you, but I will not answer them until the last 30 minutes.

## How independent consulting is different

Cons
 
- No support network
- No subsidization for professional development
- Highly variable workload

Pros

- You are your own boss.

<div class="notes">

Here are some of the ways that independent consulting is different.

On the positive side, you can pick your own hours and your own customers. You can seek out work that you like and avoid work that you dislike.

## Various business entities.

- Sole proprietorship
- Limited Liability Corporation (LLC)
- S chapter/C chapter corporation
- ~~Business partnership~~

Caution: I am not a lawyer. Also laws about business entities vary greatly from state to state.

<div class="notes">

Talk to a lawyer about these choices. A sole proprietorship is the easiest business entity to start up, but the others are not that difficult. The LLC and S/C chapter corporations offer some protection of your personal assets against creditors. The distinction between the LLC and S/C chapter corporations involves taxation.

I do not recommend a business partnership. It's very complicated to set up properly. It would be simpler for you to set up your own business entity and then subcontract some of the work to your "partner".

## Billing

You have two choices

- Bill by the project
- Bill by the hour

The average rate is $130 per hour. See the 2006 issue of the Statistical Consulting Section newsletter (v23.1).

<div class="notes">

If you bill by the project, get a scope of work in writing. If the scope of the project changes ("can I add one little thing?"), then change the

## You get paid through an invoice
